# App Icons

This directory contains the complete set of app icons for the iPad-SimEnergy application.

## Design Theme

The app icons feature a **mesh deformation** theme that represents the core functionality of the application:

- **Background**: Radial gradient from dark blue to light blue, representing the mathematical space
- **Mesh Pattern**: Curved grid lines that simulate the deformation effect users can create
- **Central Focus**: Bright focal point representing the interaction point where users touch to deform
- **Accent Dots**: Grid intersection points that show the underlying mathematical structure

## Technical Details

- **Master Icon**: 1024x1024px (AppIcon-1024.png)
- **Generated from**: Python PIL script creating programmatic artwork
- **Color Scheme**: Blue gradient (#1E3C78 to #87CEEB) with white mesh lines and orange accent
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support

## Visual Representation

The icon design reflects the app's core functionality of **similarity invariant energy minimization** for image deformation:

1. The mesh pattern shows the underlying mathematical grid structure
2. The wave deformation demonstrates how the grid can be manipulated
3. The central bright point represents user interaction points
4. The blue gradient suggests the mathematical/scientific nature of the app

This creates an immediately recognizable icon that communicates the app's purpose while maintaining visual appeal across all sizes.
