# iPad-SimEnergy Swift Migration Guide

## Project Overview

The iPad-SimEnergy app is an interactive image deformation tool that implements similarity invariant energy minimization. Users can multi-touch on images to deform them using mathematical principles based on affine maps for 2D shape interpolation.

## Migration Objectives

Modernize the iPad-SimEnergy app by migrating from Objective-C to Swift while:

- Maintaining all existing multi-touch deformation functionality
- Preserving mathematical computation accuracy
- Improving iOS compatibility and performance
- Enhancing code maintainability and readability

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Core Components

- **AppDelegate**: Application lifecycle management (Objective-C)
- **ViewController**: Main interaction controller with C++ backend (Mixed Objective-C/C++)
- **ImageMesh**: Image processing and mesh generation (Objective-C)
- **Mathematical Engine**: LAPACK-based energy minimization (C/C++)

### Key Technologies

- Multi-touch gesture recognition
- OpenGL/Metal rendering for real-time deformation
- LAPACK/Eigen for mathematical computations
- Image processing for mesh generation
